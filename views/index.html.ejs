    <div class="content">

      <p>Wroc≈Çaw (pronounced Vrots-wav; also known as Breslau, its German name, and English name until 1945) is the largest city in Lower Silesia in Poland. It is home to 630,000 people within the city limits and the metropolitan area has a population of 1.2 million making it the largest city in Western Poland.

Wroc≈Çaw is the historic capital of Silesia and it has changed hands repeatedly over the centuries. At different points throughout history, Wroc≈Çaw has been in the Kingdom of Poland, Bohemia, the Austrian Empire, Prussia and Germany. In 1945 the city became a part of Poland again as the borders of Poland were moved westwards in the immediate aftermath of World War II. The city came to international fame as it hosted a number of football matches during the Euro 2012 Championships and was one of the 2016 European Capitals of Culture. The World Games took place in Wroc≈Çaw in 2017. </p>

            <h4>Panorama Rac≈Çawicka</h4>
          </a>
          <p>The Panorama of the Battle of Rac≈Çawice is a huge 19th-century painting, whose height reaches 15 meters and length 114 meters. This unique panorama artwork is located in a round building, in a special room dedicated solely to it, where, due to extra effects such as the light and the artificial terrain right before the painting‚Äôs ground, the observer feels inserted in the picture himself. The battle presented on the artwork really took place, and therefore depicts a large number of Polish historical figures and places.</p>

            <h4>Market Square</h4>
          </a>
          <p>The Monument of an Anonymous Passer-by is constituted by 14 modern, bronze sculptures situated on the ≈öwidnicka street of Wroc≈Çaw. Amongst the anonymous people you can spot a woman with a child, a man carrying his luggage, an elderly person, and other typical characters we meet every day, no matter where we go. What is special about these sculptures is that as we approach the road, each one of them ‚Äòvanishes‚Äô deeper and deeper into the ground. The monument was originally created by the artist Jerzy Kalina in 1977 and later on moved from one of Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs museums onto the streets. Although there are many different interpretative possibilities, the monument definitely reminds us of the passing time and our changing with it.</p>

            <h4>Wroc≈Çaw‚Äôs Multimedia Fountain</h4>
          </a>
          <p>The Multimedia Fountain, created in 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Polish democratic elections, is located in the colorful Szczytnicki Park and next to the Centennial Hall. It comprises 300 nozzles that together create wonderful water multimedia shows with the use of music and color effects. The shows take place every hour. Additionally, the longer, special shows take place at 10 pm during July and August, and a bit earlier during September and October.</p>

            <h4>Centennial Hall</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Hala Stulecia, or the Centennial Hall, figures on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2006. Constructed in the 20th century by Max Berg, it is the most important cultural hall in the whole of Poland, hosting a number of concerts, conferences, exhibitions, and other similar events. The design is a clever eclectic combination of tradition and modernity, similarly to the events hosted in the hall. The Centennial Hall is located near the Szczytnicki Park and the Multimedia Fountain, and there is a possibility of visiting it aside from the events.</p>

          <p>The charming Baroque garden is surrounded by Ossolineum ‚Äì a historical non-profit foundation dating back to the partitions of Poland, which contributed substantially to the development and popularization of Polish literature. Its hedges and the central fountain create an atmosphere of elegance and order. In the center of the garden you can see the monument of the Silesian Baroque poet, Angelus Silesius. The Ossolineum building hosts a large library and reading rooms, worth visiting if you are a fan of Slavonic literatures and history.</p>
