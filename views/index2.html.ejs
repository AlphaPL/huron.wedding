      <p>Lee's love of modern architecture and Ash's love of the desert landscape
      brings us all to one of our favorite vacation spots. We're excited to share
      it with our friends and family. South of the Mojave Desert and in the
      eastern shadow of the San Jacinto Mountains, Palm Springs is an oasis town
      that charmed the 1930's Hollywood elite and became a hotspot of post-war
      architecture in the 1950's. Beyond the city are some fantastic landscapes
      like Joshua Tree, a national park larger than the state of Rhode Island
      named after the tree that inspired Dr. Seuss.</p>

          <h3>Palm Springs Airport (PSP)</h3>
          <p>A 10-minute cab ride from Ace Hotel &amp; Swim Club, the all-outdoor
          Palm Springs Airport is the quickest and easiest way to get to Palm Springs.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Los Angeles Airport (LAX)</h3>
          <p>A 2 to 3 hour drive from Palm Springs, we only recommend flying into
          Los Angeles if you're picking up family or exploring the area before or
          after the weekend.</p>

            Wear a suit and tie in whatever color you look best in (it doesn't have
            to be black). Lee suggests a bow tie. If you have one, a cotton or linen
            suit will be more comfortable than wool in the summer heat.
