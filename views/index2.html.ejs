        <h2>Palm Springs, California</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">

      <p>Lee's love of modern architecture and Ash's love of the desert landscape
      brings us all to one of our favorite vacation spots. We're so excited to share
      it with you. In the Coachella Valley, South of the Mojave Desert and in the
      eastern shadow of the San Jacinto Mountains, Palm Springs is an oasis town
      that charmed the 1930's Hollywood elite and became a hotspot of post-war
      architecture in the 1950's. Beyond the city are some fantastic landscapes
      like Joshua Tree a national park larger than the state of Rhode Island named
      after the tree that inspired Dr. Seuss.</p>

      <h3>Getting There</h3>

      <div class="columns">
        <div>
          <h4>Palm Springs Airport (PSP)</h4>
          <p>A 10-minute cab ride from Ace Hotel &amp; Swim Club, the all-outdoor
          Palm Springs Airport is the quickest and easiest way to get to Palm Springs.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Los Angeles Airport (LAX)</h4>
          <p>A 2 to 3 hour drive from Palm Springs, we only recommend flying into
          Los Angeles if you're picking up family or exploring the area before or
          after the weekend.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Weather Report</h3>
      <p>
        Palm Springs has a desert climate. It's hot, dry and reliably sunny in
        the day time, expect highs in the low 90s. At night the temperature drops
        to the mid 60s. It almost never rains in May. Don't forget to pack a
        sweater for the cool evenings or a trip up the tramway.

      but appropriate for the summer heat.</p>

          <h4>Gents</h4>
          <p>
            Wear a suit in whatever color you look best in (it doesn't have
            to be dark). Definitely wear a tie, of course Lee suggests a bow tie.
            If you have one, a cotton or linen suit will be more comfortable than
            wool in the heat.
          </p>

      <h3>Festive Attire</h3>

          <p>
            Have fun and look good. Try a suit in a bright color or a fun patterned
